Task:
The World Bank was very impressed with your deliverables on the previous
assignment and they have a new project for you.
You are required to produce a scatterplot depicting Life Expectancy (y-axis) and
Fertility Rate (x-axis) statistics by Country. The scatterplot needs to also be categorised by Countriesâ€™ Regions.
You have been supplied with data for 2 years: 1960 and 2013 and you are required
to produce a visualisation for each of these years.
Some data has been provided in a csv file, some - in R vectors. The csv file contains
combined data for both years. All data manipulations have to be performed in R (not
in excel) because this project may be audited at a later stage.
You have also been requested to provide insights into how the two periods compare
